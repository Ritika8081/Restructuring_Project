# 📊 Widget Dashboard - Modular System

![Chords Playground](Public/images/Node_PlayGround.png)

A modular, drag-and-drop widget dashboard built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. Originally a 1000+ line monolithic component, now restructured into 8 clean, maintainable modules.

## ✔ Best scalable pattern (Used in Node-RED, LabVIEW, MaxMSP, BioSignal tools)

Signal routing is per-channel, not per-node.

Meaning:

- Every processing node consumes one channel.

- If a user wants 4 channels → they drag 4 BandPower nodes (one per channel).

This avoids:

- Cross-channel interference

- Timing mismatches

- Buffer alignment issues

- UI complexity

- Routing errors

Why this is good for our application:

- Clarity & single responsibility: Each processing node handles one channel, making it easy to reason about state and behavior.
- Independent timing & buffers: Per-channel nodes use their own buffers and internal state, avoiding accidental misalignment when channels start or stop.
- Easy debugging and configuration: Users can tweak band, window, or filter settings per-channel without affecting others.
- Scalable UI: The flow and dashboard stay predictable — adding or removing channels is explicit and localized.
- Compatibility with existing architecture: Our provider already applies per-channel filters and widgets prefer published outputs from single-source nodes, so this pattern maps naturally to the codebase.

Recommendation summary: favor one processing node per channel for most use-cases; only consolidate into multi-channel nodes when you need tight, optimized, or algorithmically coupled multi-channel processing (e.g., beamforming, PCA).

## 📚 Quick Reference

Key files and their purposes:

- `src/app/widgets/page.tsx` - Main dashboard component (~300 lines)
- `src/components/DraggableWidget.tsx` - Individual widget logic (~330 lines)
- `src/components/WidgetPalette.tsx` - System controls (~260 lines)
- `src/types/widget.types.ts` - TypeScript definitions (~50 lines)
- `src/utils/widget.utils.ts` - Utility functions (~116 lines)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict typing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: WebGL Plot for high-performance visualization
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useCallback, useMemo)

## 🎯 Architecture Benefits

✅ **Maintainable**: 8 focused files instead of 1 monolithic component  
✅ **Testable**: Isolated components with clear interfaces  
✅ **Performant**: Memoized components and efficient re-rendering  
✅ **Extensible**: Easy to add new widget types and features  
✅ **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors
